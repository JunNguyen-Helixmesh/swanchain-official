          <p>You consent to receive all communications, agreements, documents, receipts, notices, and disclosures electronically (collectively, our “

            <strong>Protected Parties</strong>”) from any claim, demand, lawsuit, action, proceeding, investigation, liability, damage, loss, cost or expense, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or relating to your

            the applicable Protected Party) will have the right, in its sole discretion, to control any action or proceeding and to determine whether Swan wishes to settle, and if so, on what terms.</p>
          <h3>8. DISCLOSURES; DISCLAIMERS</h3>
          <p>Swan is a developer of open-source software. Swan does not operate a virtual currency or derivatives exchange platform or offer trade execution or clearing services and therefore has no oversight, involvement, or control with respect
            to your transactions.</p>
          <p>You are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to your transactions, including, but not limited to, the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
            Commission (“
            <strong>CFTC</strong>”), and the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).</p>
          <p>You understand that Swan is not registered or licensed by the CFTC, SEC or any financial regulatory authority. No financial regulatory authority has reviewed or approved the use of the Swan open-source software. The Website, the Services,
            and the Swan open-source software do not constitute advice or a recommendation concerning any commodity, security, or other asset. Swan is not acting as an investment adviser or commodity trading adviser to any person.
          </p>
          <p>Swan does not own or control the underlying software protocols. In general, the underlying protocols are open-source, and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them. Swan is not responsible for the operation of the underlying
            protocols, and Swan makes no guarantee of their functionality, security, or availability.</p>
          <p>To the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law, the Website and the Services (and any of their content or functionality) provided by or on behalf of us are provided on an “
            <strong>AS IS</strong>” and “
            <strong>AS AVAILABLE</strong>” basis, and we expressly disclaim, and you hereby waive, any representations, conditions or warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, legal, statutory or otherwise, or arising from statute, otherwise
            in law, course of dealing, or usage of trade, including, without limitation, the implied or legal warranties and conditions of merchantability, merchantable quality, quality or fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, availability,
            reliability, accuracy, quiet enjoyment and non-infringement of third party rights. Without limiting the foregoing, we do not represent or warrant that the Website or the Services (including any related data) will be uninterrupted,
            available at any particular time or error-free. Further, we do not warrant that errors in the Website or the Service are correctable or will be corrected.</p>
          <p>You acknowledge that your data on the Website or through the Services may become irretrievably lost or corrupted or temporarily unavailable due to a variety of causes, and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted under Applicable
            Law, we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by denial-of-service attacks, software failures, viruses or other technologically harmful materials (including those which may infect your computer equipment), protocol changes
            by third party providers, Internet outages, force majeure events or other disasters, scheduled or unscheduled maintenance, or other causes either within or outside our control.</p>
          <p>The disclaimer of implied warranties contained in these Terms may not apply if and to the extent such warranties cannot be excluded or limited under the Applicable Law of the jurisdiction in which you reside.</p>
          <h3>9. EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED DAMAGES</h3>
          <p>In no event will Swan, together with any Protected Party, be liable for any incidental, indirect, special, punitive, exemplary, consequential or similar damages or liabilities whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for
            loss of data, information, revenue, goodwill, profits or other business or financial benefit) arising out of or in connection with the Website, the Services and Swan (and any of their content and functionality), any execution or
            settlement of a transaction, any performance or non-performance of the Services, your Distributed Ledger Technology assets, other digital assets, or any other product, service or other item provided by or on behalf of a Protected
            Party, whether under contract, tort (including negligence), civil liability, statute, strict liability, breach of warranties, or under any other theory of liability, and whether or not any Protected Party has been advised of, knew
            of or should have known of the possibility of such damages and notwithstanding any failure of the essential purpose of these Terms or any limited remedy nor is Swan in any way responsible for the execution or settlement of transactions
            between users of Swan open-source software or Swan.</p>
          <h3>10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
          <p>In no event will the Protected Parties' aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with the Website, the Services and Swan (and any of their content and functionality), any performance or non-performance of the Services, your
            Distributed Ledger Technology assets, other digital assets, or any other product, service or other item provided by or on behalf of a Protected Party, whether under contract, tort (including negligence), civil liability, statute,
            strict liability or other theory of liability exceed the amount of fees paid by you to us under these Terms in the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim for liability.</p>
          <h3>11. RELEASE</h3>
          <p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, in consideration for being allowed to use the Website, the Services and/or Swan, you hereby release and forever discharge Swan and all Protected Parties from, and hereby waive and relinquish,
            each and every past, present and future dispute, claim, controversy, demand, right, obligation, liability, action and cause of action of every kind and nature (including personal injuries, death, and property damage), that has arisen
            or arises directly or indirectly out of, or that relates directly or indirectly to, the Website, the Services and/or Swan (including any interactions with, or act or omission of, other Website or Swan Network users or any third-party
            services). YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY APPLICABLE PROVISION IN LAW OR REGULATION IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING, WHICH STATES IN SUBSTANCE: “
            <strong>A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT
              WITH THE DEBTOR</strong>.”</p>
          <h3>12. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION</h3>
          <p>Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Swan and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions
            set forth below. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.</p>
          <p>You and Swan agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Swan and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration,
            class action or any other type of representative proceeding.</p>
          <p>Except for small claims disputes in which you or Swan seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county or other applicable jurisdiction where you reside or disputes in which you or Swan seeks injunctive
            or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and Swan waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court. Instead,
            for any dispute or claim that you have against Swan or relating in any way to the Services, you agree to first contact Swan and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“
            <strong>Notice</strong>”) to Swan by email at
            <a :href="`mailto:${email_link}`">{{email_link}}</a>. The Notice must include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number, describe the nature and basis of the claim and set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar
            in form to that described above. If you and Swan cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by
            the American Arbitration Association (“
            <strong>AAA</strong>”), or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All disputes submitted to AAA will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in
            accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“
            <strong>AAA Rules</strong>”). The most recent version of the AAA Rules are available on the AAA website and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the AAA Rules or waive your
            opportunity to read the AAA Rules and waive any claim that the AAA Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>
          <p>You and Swan agree that the enforceability of this Section 12 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “
            <strong>FAA</strong>”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any
            dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than
            one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>
          <p>The arbitrator, Swan, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or
            related to the disputes. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure
            is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement,
            or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</p>
          <p>You and Swan agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and Swan will pay the remaining AAA fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Swan, Swan will pay all AAA fees and costs. </p>
          <p>Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Swan will not have the right to assert the
            claim.
          </p>
          <p>You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 12 by emailing us at
            <a :href="`mailto:${email_link}`">{{email_link}}</a>. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration.</p>
          <p>If any portion of this Section 12 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms, severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no
            impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 12 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis under this Section 12, and to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on
            a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims will be stayed pending
            the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 12 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief
            is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 12 will be enforceable. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with Section 12.</p>
          <h3>13. GOVERNING LAW</h3>
          <p>The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and any dispute related to these Terms, the Website or the Services, will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Canada, as applicable, without regard
            to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of Canada or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. You agree that we may initiate a proceeding related to the enforcement or
            validity of our intellectual property rights in any court having jurisdiction. With respect to any other proceeding that is not subject to arbitration under these Terms, the courts located in Canada will have exclusive jurisdiction.
            You waive any objection to venue in any such courts.</p>
          <h3>14. RISK FACTORS</h3>
          <p>You acknowledge the following serious risks to any use of the Website or the Services or the Link Token and expressly agree to not hold any Protected Parties liable should any of the following risks occur:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Risk of Regulatory Actions in One or More Jurisdictions:</strong> The Website or the Services could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of Swan to continue
              to develop the Website or Services, or which could impede or limit your ability to use the Website or Services.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Risk of Alternative, Unofficial Swan Networks:</strong> It is possible that alternative Swan-based networks could be established, which utilize the same open source code and open source protocol underlying Swan and/or Services.
              Swan may compete with these alternative Swan-based networks, which could potentially negatively impact Swan, the Services and/or the products.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Risk of Insufficient Interest in Swan or Distributed Applications:</strong> It is possible that Swan Network will not be used by a large number of external businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will be
              limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed applications. Such a lack of interest could impact the development of Swan and potential uses of products. Swan cannot predict the success of its own development
              efforts or the efforts of other third parties.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Risk that the Website and Services, as Developed, Will Not Meet the Expectations of User:</strong> You recognize that the Website, Services and Swan are under development and may undergo significant changes over time. You acknowledge
              that any expectations regarding the form and functionality of Swan held by you may not be met for any number of reasons including a change in the design and implementation plans, specifications and execution of the implementation
              of the Website, Services or Swan.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Risk of Security Weaknesses in Swan Core Infrastructure Software:</strong> The Website, Services and Swan rest on open-source software, and there is a risk that the Protected Parties, or other third parties not directly affiliated
              with Swan, may introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Website, Services or Swan causing the system to lose tokens stored in one or more of your accounts or other accounts or lose sums of other
              valued tokens. Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to develop and maintain the Website, Services and Swan, the Website, Services and Swan may experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained,
              which may negatively impact the Website, Services, Swan products.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography:</strong> Cryptography is an art, not a science. And the state of the art can advance over time. Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such
              as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Website, Services and Swan which could result in the theft or loss of tokens. To the extent within its control and otherwise possible, Swan
              intends to update the protocol underlying the Services and Swan to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but it cannot predict the future of cryptography or guarantee that any
              security updates will be made in a timely or successful manner.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Risk of Blockchain Network Attacks:</strong> Any blockchain used for the Services and/or Swan may be susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to: double-spend attacks, reorganizations, majority mining power attacks,
              “
              <strong>selfish-mining</strong>” attacks, and work race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Services, Swan, expected proper execution and sequencing of transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing
              of contract computations. Known or novel mining attacks may be successful.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Risk of Rapid Adoption and Insufficiency of Computational Application Processing Power of the Services and Swan:</strong> If the Services and/or Swan are rapidly adopted, the demand for transaction processing and distributed application
              computations could rise dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the rate with which Swan services can be provided. Under such a scenario, the Services and Swan Network could become destabilized, due to the increased cost of running
              distributed applications. In turn, this could dampen interest in the Services, and Swan products. Insufficiency of computational resources and an associated rise in the price of tokens could result in businesses being unable to
              acquire scarce computational resources to run their distributed applications. This could result in lost revenues and disruption or halting of business operations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Risks Associated with New and Evolving Laws:</strong> Swan, and by extension the Website and Services, may be subject to a variety of international laws and regulations, including those with respect to financial or securities regulations,
              consumer privacy, data protection, consumer protection, content regulation, network neutrality, cyber security, data protection, intellectual property (including copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws), defamation,
              and others. Such laws and regulations, and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could change. In addition, new laws or regulations affecting Swan could be enacted. As the Website, Services and Swan prpduct
              evolve, we may be subject to new laws, and the application of existing laws to us might change. These laws and regulations are frequently costly to comply with and may divert a significant portion of Swan’s attention and resources
              or restrict the way the Swan may operate. If we fail to comply with these applicable laws or regulations, we could receive negative publicity and be subject to significant liabilities which could adversely impact the Website, Services,
              and Swan products. Additionally, node operators of Swan may be subject to industry specific laws and regulations or licensing requirements. If any of these parties fails to comply with any of these licensing requirements or other
              applicable laws or regulations, or if such laws and regulations or licensing requirements become more stringent or are otherwise expanded, Swan could be adversely impacted.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>15. MISCELLANEOUS</h3>
          <p>Any right or remedy of Swan set forth in these Terms is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right or remedy whether described in these Terms, under Applicable Law, at law or in equity. Our failure or delay in exercising any
            right, power, or privilege under these Terms will not operate as a waiver thereof. The invalidity or unenforceability of any of these Terms will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of which
            will remain in full force and effect. We will have no responsibility or liability for any failure or delay in performance of the Website or any of the Services, or any loss or damage that you may incur, due to any circumstance or

            failure, or equipment or software malfunction. You may not assign or transfer any right to use the Website or the Services, or any of your rights or obligations under these Terms, without our express prior written consent, including
            by operation of law or in connection with any change of control. We may assign or transfer any or all of our rights or obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, without notice or obtaining your consent or approval. Headings
            of sections are for convenience only and will not be used to limit or construe such sections. These Terms contain the entire agreement and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings between the parties regarding the Website
            and the Services. If there is a conflict between these Terms and any other agreement you may have with us, these Terms will control unless the other agreement specifically identifies these Terms and declares that the other agreement
